An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem 

Algorithms are in everything we do.

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm usually means a small procedure that solves a recurrent problem.

Computer algorithms work via input and output. They take the input and apply each step of the algorithm to that information to generate an output.

for ex: A search engine algorithm, for example, takes search strings of keywords and operators as input, 
	searches its associated database for relevant web pages, and returns results.

An encryption algorithm transforms data according to specified actions to protect it

 word algorithm derives from the name of the mathematician, Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi

how to prepare a cake?




















Preheat the oven
Gather the ingredients
Measure out the ingredients
Mix together the ingredients to make the batter
Grease a pan
Pour the batter into the pan
Put the pan in the oven
Set a timer
When the timer goes off, take the pan out of the oven
Enjoy!

 For example, our algorithm for a child's morning routine could be the following:

Wake up and turn off alarm
Get dressed
Brush teeth
Eat breakfast
Go to school

types:
=======
Divide and conquer algorithms 
Greedy algorithms 
Recursive algorithms
Brute force algorithms

Algorithmic thinking allows students to break down problems and conceptualize solutions in terms of discrete steps. Being able
to understand and implement an algorithm requires students to practice structured thinking and reasoning abilities..


Qualities of Good Algorithms:
================================
Input and output should be defined clearly.
Each steps should be clear and correct.
Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. 
Instead, it should be written in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.


1. Add two numbers entered by the user

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables num1, num2 and sum. 
Step 3: Read values num1 and num2. 
Step 4: Add num1 and num2 and assign the result to sum.
        sum←num1+num2 
Step 5: Display sum 
Step 6: Stop

2. Find the largest number among three numbers

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables a,b and c.
Step 3: Read variables a,b and c.
Step 4: If a > b
           If a > c
              Display a is the largest number.
           Else
              Display c is the largest number.
        Else
           If b > c
              Display b is the largest number.
           Else
              Display c is the greatest number.  
Step 5: Stop

3. Find the factorial of a number

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables n, factorial and i.
Step 3: Initialize variables
          factorial ← 1
          i ← 1
Step 4: Read value of n
Step 5: Repeat the steps until i = n
     5.1: factorial ← factorial*i
     5.2: i ← i+1
Step 6: Display factorial
Step 7: Stop

4. Check whether a number is prime or not

Flowcharts:
============

Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields. 
This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution to a given problem.

Pseudocode:
============

Pseudocode is a simple way of writing programming code in English

not actual programming language

Common psuedocode verbs:

Input: READ, OBTAIN, GET
Output: PRINT, DISPLAY, SHOW
Compute: COMPUTE, CALCULATE, DETERMINE
Initialize: SET, INIT
Add one: INCREMENT, BUMP


Once you know what the program is about and how it will function, then you can use pseudocode to create statements to achieve the required results for your program.

For ex:

Start Program
Enter two numbers, A, B
Add the numbers together
Print Sum
End Program

compute the area of a rectangle:

Get the length, l, and width, w
Compute the area = l*w
Display the area

TO FIND THE LARGEST OF TWO NUMBERS:

BEGIN
 
  NUMERIC nNum1,nNum2
  DISPLAY "ENTER THE FIRST NUMBER : "
  INPUT nNum1
 
  DISPLAY "ENTER THE SECOND NUMBER : "
  INPUT nNum2
 
  IF nNum1 > nNum2
    DISPLAY nNum1 + " is larger than "+ nNum2
  ELSE
   DISPLAY nNum2 + " is larger than " + nNum1
 
END

TO FIND THE SUM OF TWO NUMBERS
===============================
begin
    numeric nNum1,nNum2,nSum
    display "ENTER THE FIRST NUMBER : "
    accept nNum1
    display "ENTER THE SECOND NUMBER : "
    accept nNum2
    compute nSum=nNum1+nNum2
    display "SUM OF THESE NUMBER : " nSum
end

WRITE A PSEUDOCODE TO FIND THE AREA OF RECTANGLE:
===================================================

begin 
    numeric nLen,nBrd,nAre
    display "ENTER THE LENGTH OF RECTANGLE : "
    accept nLen
    display "ENTER THE BREADTH OF RECTANGLE : "
    accept nBrd
    nAre=nLen*nBrd
    display "AREA OF RECTANGLE : " nAre
end

FIND THE GREATEST OF THREE NUMBERS:
======================================
https://www.code4example.com/pseudocode/pseudocode-examples/

begin 
    numeric nNum1, nNum2, nNum3
    display "ENTER THE FIRST NUMBER : "
    accept nNum1
    display "ENTER THE SECOND NUMBER : "
    accept nNum2
    display "ENTER THE THIRD NUMBER : "
    accept nNum3
    Num=nNum1
    if(Num<nNum2)
    begin
        Num=nNum2
    end
    if(Num<nNum3)
    begin
        Num=nNum3
    end
    display "GREATEST ONE : " Num
end

WRITE A PSEUDOCODE TO DISPLAY THE STUDENT NAME ACCORDING TO THEIR ROLL NO.


begin
    numeric nRoll
    display "ENTER STUDENT ROLL : "
    accept nRoll
    switch(nRoll)
    begin
        case 1 : display "ANKIT"
            break;
        case 2 : display "RAHUL"
            break;
        case 3 : display "AMIT"
            break;
        case 4 : display "GAURAV"
            break;
        case 5 : display "NITESH"
            break;
        case 6 : display "VISHAL"
            break;
        case 7 : display "CHITRANJAN"
            break;
        case 8 : display "KAUSHAL"
            break;
        case 9 : display "DHIRENDRA"
            break;
        default : display "OUT OF RANGE"
    end
end
